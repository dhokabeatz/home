# AWS S3 Setup Guide for Image Uploads

## Overview

The portfolio application now supports S3 image uploads using presigned URLs. This allows secure, direct uploads from the frontend to AWS S3.

## Required AWS Setup

### 1. Create an S3 Bucket

```bash
# Using AWS CLI (optional)
aws s3 mb s3://your-portfolio-bucket-name --region us-east-1
```

Or create through AWS Console:

1. Go to AWS S3 Console
2. Click "Create bucket"
3. Choose a unique name (e.g., `henry-portfolio-media`)
4. Select region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
5. Enable public read access for uploaded files
6. Create bucket

### 2. Configure CORS Policy

Add this CORS policy to your S3 bucket:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3003",
      "http://localhost:3004",
      "https://yourdomain.com"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
  }
]
```

### 3. Create IAM User

1. Go to IAM Console
2. Create new user for the application
3. Attach policy with S3 permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-portfolio-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Update Environment Variables

Update `backend/.env`:

```properties
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-actual-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-actual-secret-access-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-portfolio-bucket-name
```

## Features Implemented

### Backend Endpoints

- `POST /api/upload/presigned-url` - Generate presigned URL for upload
- `POST /api/upload/confirm` - Confirm successful upload

### Frontend Features

- **AdminMedia**: Direct S3 image uploads with progress feedback
- **File Validation**: Type and size validation (images only, max 10MB)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and loading states
- **Gallery Management**: View uploaded files and project screenshots

### Usage

1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard â†’ Media
2. Click "Upload Files" or drag and drop images
3. Files are uploaded directly to S3
4. Public URLs are returned and stored in the gallery

## Security Features

- Presigned URLs expire in 5 minutes
- Authentication required for upload endpoint
- File type validation (images only)
- File size limits (10MB max)

## Next Steps

To complete the integration:

1. Add AWS credentials to your environment
2. Create and configure S3 bucket
3. Test image uploads in the admin panel
4. Consider adding project screenshot management
